<p>Earlier this year while moving back to the northeast from Austin Texas, I spent some time in Arkansas with the talented <a href='http://arlton.com' target='_blank'>Arlton Lowry</a>. We've been meaning to work on a project together for a few years and came up with <a href='http://grades.io'>Grades.io</a> which I'm happy to say is ready for action.</p>
<p>We've launched the beta site where teachers are able to set up their classes, add students and create assignments. We've already been covered on <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/13/grades-io-launches-to-simplify-and-beautify-college-classroom-management/'>techcrunch</a> and have received a bunch of great feedback which we're actively rolling into the site. If you're at all interested in the education space, I urge you to check it out and let us know what you think!</p>
