<h1>(DRAFT) Jumping Out</h1>
<h3>10 February 2013</h3>

<p>Six months ago, I did something that some would relate to jumping out of a perfectly good airplane. I had an enjoyable job working with great people, and I left.</p>

<p>Convincing myself to leave took time, and there were a few questions that needed to be answered. The idea started to pick up momentum when Alex MacCaw released his post on <a href='http://alexmaccaw.com/posts/traveling_writing_programming'>Traveling, Writing and Programming</a>. It really struck a chord with me, and I constantly referred back to it and other similar articles leading up to my departure. I had been freelancing on the side since 2004 (middle school), so the concept wasn't new, but using it as my primary source of income while traveling around the world was slightly intimmidating. It was going to be one heck of an adventure, without a doubt.</p>

<p>My primary concern was about how I was going to find work. I had been very active in the NYC tech community and was constantly networking, which proved to be invaluable. If you're considering freelancing, I can't stress the importance of networking enough. After reaching out to a few companies I knew were actively looking for developers, I was convinced that there was no shortage in work. Just about every tech company in the city is looking for developers, and most are more than willing to work with freelancers on a contract basis.</p>

<p>Out of the gate, I had some smaller stuff lined up and was ready to do something big. I'm always networking, so I had a good amount of people to reach out to for work, which set me up with some eciting mediam sized (1-3 month) part time projects. I spent very little time actually planning from here on out, and everythign went great. Within a month or two, I was living in Florida working for a northeastern based client. I was sure to only pick up work I was interested in, which helped me stay focused. I would set milestones of number of worked hours, which translted to income. By the 4th month, I was making close to 3 times what I was making at my salary job, and by now, I'm past 4 times as much. I'm back from Florida, keys, and staying in NYC for some time. Planning my trip to Europe, which is exciting.</p>

Future
<p>For the future, my goals are focused around keeping am ore structured routine and traveling.</p>
