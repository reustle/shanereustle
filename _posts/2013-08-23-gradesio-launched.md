title: Grades.io Launched
---

Earlier this year while moving back to the northeast from Austin Texas, I spent some time in Arkansas with the talented [Arlton Lowry](http://arlton.com). We've been meaning to work on a project together for a few years and came up with [Grades.io](http://grades.io) which I'm happy to say is ready for action.

We've launched the beta site where teachers are able to set up their classes, add students and create assignments. We've already been covered on [techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/13/grades-io-launches-to-simplify-and-beautify-college-classroom-management/') and have received a bunch of great feedback which we're actively rolling into the site. If you're at all interested in the education space, I urge you to check it out and let us know what you think!
