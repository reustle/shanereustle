Here are some quick and dirty tips I've picked up while living in the city for a few months.

## Connectivity
* Pick up a TRUE sim card and ask for any of the [following monthly 4G plans](http://truemoveh.truecorp.co.th/4g/sim-truemoveh/prepaid/entry/3340), not the tourist plans. They offer a good amount of data for the price such as 300/mo for 2.5gb, 700/mo for 5gb, etc. You'll also get unlimited access to WiFi hotspots all over the city (ie true coffee, see below)


## Accomodation
* [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Bangkok--Thailand?sublets=monthly) has a bunch of listings for beautiful, cheap monthly apartments
* If you're just passing through, [Lub d (Siam)](http://siamsquare.lubd.com/) is a clean, cheap hostel in a great location. Helpful staff and plenty of travelers hanging out around the lobby looking for an adventure
* For something a bit quieter, but still convient, check out [HQ Hostel](http://www.hqhostel.com/)


## Transportation
* Avoid tuk tuks, they're for tourists and will rip you off. Go for the experience if you wish
* If you're going to be moving around the city often, pick up a [Rabbit Card](http://www.bts.co.th/customer/en/16-rabbit-step-chg-sky-to-rabbit.aspx) for the BTS to avoid digging for change every time you need to ride. Ask for one at any ticket counter
* BTS note: The last train of the night leaves the origin station at midnight
* When taking a taxi, make sure they turn the meter on. If they offer you a price, it is probably much higher than what the meter will charge you. Sometimes they won't turn it on, so just get out and find another cab


## Workspace
* My favorite place to work in the city is any [TRUE Coffee location](http://truecoffee.truecorp.co.th/). They're all over the place and usually have a few seats open. If you've got a TRUE sim, you'll also have unlimited access to their fast WiFi network
* [Tom n Toms Coffee](http://en.tomntoms.com/main.php) is a good 24 hour option if you need to crank some work out at 3am
* There are 2 popular coworking spaces, [The Hive](http://thehive.co.th/) and [Hubba](http://hubbathailand.com/), but they're pretty expensive for Bangkok standards
