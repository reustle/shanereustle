Here are some quick and dirty tips I've picked up while living in the city for a few months. Bangkok is a great city, and you'll fall in love with the countless night markets and delicious (dirt cheap) street food.

## Connectivity
* Pick up a TRUE sim card and ask for any of the [monthly 4G plans](http://truemoveh.truecorp.co.th/4g/sim-truemoveh/prepaid/entry/3340) (not a tourist plan). They offer a good amount of data for the price such as 300 bhat/mo for 2.5gb, 700 bhat/mo for 5gb, etc. You'll also get unlimited access to WiFi hotspots all over the city (ie true coffee, see below)


## Accomodation
* [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Bangkok--Thailand?sublets=monthly) has a bunch of listings for beautiful, cheap monthly apartments
* If you're just passing through, [Lub d (Siam)](http://siamsquare.lubd.com/) is a clean, cheap hostel in a great location. Helpful staff and plenty of travelers hanging out around the lobby looking for an adventure
* For something a bit quieter, but still convenient, check out [HQ Hostel](http://www.hqhostel.com/)


## Neighborhoods
* Siam is the center of the city. Both train lines meet here, and there are plenty of malls, restaurants, and pepole. I usually stay here so everything I need is within walking distance
* Ekkamai is also a popular choice, only about 6 km east of Siam. Here is where you'll find the popular coworking spaces and a good number of expats


## Transportation
* Avoid tuk tuks, they're for tourists and will rip you off. Ride for the experience if you wish
* If you're going to be moving around the city often, pick up a [Rabbit Card](http://www.bts.co.th/customer/en/16-rabbit-step-chg-sky-to-rabbit.aspx) for the BTS to avoid digging around for change every time you need to ride. Ask for one at any ticket counter
* BTS note: The last train of the night leaves the origin station at midnight
* When taking a taxi, make sure they turn the meter on. If they offer you a price, it is probably much higher than what the meter will charge you. Sometimes they won't turn it on, so just get out and find another cab


## Workspace
* My favorite place to work in the city is any [TRUE Coffee location](http://truecoffee.truecorp.co.th/). They're all over the place and usually have a few seats open. If you've got a TRUE sim, you'll also have unlimited access to their fast WiFi network
* [Tom n Toms Coffee](http://en.tomntoms.com/main.php) is a good 24 hour option if you need to crank some work out at 3am
* There are 2 popular coworking spaces, [The Hive](http://thehive.co.th/) and [Hubba](http://hubbathailand.com/), but I generally stuck to coffee shops


## Activities
* Climb the Ghost Tower, [Sathorn Unique](http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bangkoks-ghost-tower-the-sathorn-unqiue). This is getting more difficult as more people try to go, but the view is beautiful (picture above)
* Explore southern Bangkok (Bangkrachao) by bicycle. This is a really cool [monthly event](https://www.couchsurfing.com/events/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_query=Bangkok&latitude=13.783362&longitude=100.342133&country=&region=&start_date=&end_date=&keyword=Bangkrachao)
