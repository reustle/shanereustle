				<h1>Shane Reustle Website</h1>

				<h1>Martin Motorsports</h1>
				<p><a href="http://martinmoto.com">MartinMoto.com</a> is a site I developed for a local motorcycle dealer. I wrote the content management system and administration panel using PHP, but am currently in the process of rewriting it using Django and MongoDB. It gives the staff the ability to write and publish articles, create module blocks, manage unit inventory, take financing and employment applications, manage e-commerce categories and orders, along with a list of other things.</p>
