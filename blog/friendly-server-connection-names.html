<h1>Friendly Server Connection Names</h1>
<h3>16 January 2013</h3>

<p>Keeping track of which machines you're SSHed into can be a pain, especially when you're dealing with a large number of connections. At one point, I was connecting to 30+ machines every morning to monitor things like htop, mongostat, iostat and misc log files. Looking at 30 tabs in terminal named <em>ubuntu@ip-10-95-85-205:~$</em> was not very helpful.</p>
<p>Below is a snippet of code I wrote at the end of my <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> file which sets the command prefix to <em>MachineName:~$</em> and attempts to set the title of the terminal tab to <em>MachineName</em>. Be sure to update the variable in the first line.</p>

<pre>
export machine_name='MachineName'
PS1='$machine_name:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
echo -n -e "\033]0;$machine_name\007"
</pre>

<p>Hopefully this makes managing your connections a little bit easier. Enjoy!</p>
